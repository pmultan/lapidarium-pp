		<h1>Slanický ostrov - Partner Soft - Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Privacy policy</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (“Personal Information”) in the “Slanický ostrov” mobile application (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Collection of information</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Mobile Application and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the Mobile Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Privacy of children</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Mobile Application and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use and processing of collected information</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Mobile Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used to help us run and operate the Mobile Application and Services.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">To maintain the highest level of privacy and to protect your Personal Information to the full extent, we do not share your Personal Information with anyone and for any reason.</p>

			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>

			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Mobile Application and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Mobile Application and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>

			<br/>
		</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.</p>

		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Mobile Application and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>

		<p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and Services has been compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.</p>
